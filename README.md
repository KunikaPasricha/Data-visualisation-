# Data-visualisation-
The aim of this project is to collect, clean, and analyze a large dataset using Python and present the findings in a compelling way using data visualization tools like Matplotlib or ggplot2. The project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in data manipulation and analysis, as well as the ability to communicate insights through visual storytelling.
USAGE : 
Load your data into the project using pd.read_csv() or other data import methods.
Clean the data by removing any missing values or duplicates using df.dropna() and df.drop_duplicates().
Manipulate and analyze the data as needed, using groupby(), agg(), and other Pandas functions.
Visualize the data using Matplotlib, ggplot2, or other data visualization libraries.
Save and share your visualizations as needed.
